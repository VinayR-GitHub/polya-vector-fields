    Let $f(z)$ be a function of $z \in \mathbb{C}$.<br />
    Let there exist a curve denoted $C \subset \mathbb{C}$, such that there exists a continuous range of values $\lambda \in [\alpha, \beta]$ with $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $C$ is described as below:<br />
    $z = \sigma + i\tau \in C, \sigma = f(\lambda), \tau = g(\lambda)$<br /><br />
    If $C$ is closed over $\mathbb{C}$, let there exist an integral $I_c$ defined as below:<br />
    $\Huge I_c = \oint_C f(z) dz$<br /><br />
    If $C$ is not a closed contour over $\mathbb{C}$, let there exist an integral $I_o$ defined as below:<br />
    $\Huge I_o = \int_C f(z) dz$<br /><br />
    We also define $f(z) = u(x + iy) + iv(x + iy)$ with $z = x + iy$. Hence:<br />
    $\Huge I_c = \oint_C u(z) dz + i \oint_C v(z) dz, I_o = \int_C u(z) dz + i \oint_C v(z) dz$<br /><br />
    Let there exist a vector field denoted $\vec{v}(z)$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$, such that $\vec{v}(z) = \overline{f(z)}$. <br />
    Note that $\mathbb{C}$ can be described as Euclidean space, under the angle definition:<br />
    $\Huge e ^ {i\theta} = \textup{cos}(\theta) + i \textup{sin}(\theta)$<br /><br />
    Let these angles be directional.
