Let $f(z)$ be a function of $z \in \mathbb{C}$.

Let there exist a curve denoted $C \subset \mathbb{C}$, such that there exists a continuous range of values $\lambda \in [\alpha, \beta]$ with $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $C$ is described as below:<br/>
$z = \sigma + i\tau \in C, \sigma = f(\lambda), \tau = g(\lambda)$

If $C$ is closed over $\mathbb{C}$, let there exist an integral $I_c$ defined as below:<br/>
$I_c=\oint_C f(z) dz$

If $C$ is not a closed contour over $\mathbb{C}$, let there exist an integral $I_o$ defined as below:<br/>
$I_o=\int_C f(z) dz$

Let there exist a vector field denoted $\vec{v}(z)$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$, such that $\vec{v}(z) = \overline{f(z)}$.
