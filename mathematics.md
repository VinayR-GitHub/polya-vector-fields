Let $f(z)$ be a function of $z \in \mathbb{C}$.

Let there exist a vector field denoted $\vec{v}(z)$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$, such that $\vec{v}(z) = \overline{f(z)}$.

Let the position of a point under the action of the vector field at time $t \in \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \\{0\\}$ can be given by $\varrho(z, t; \vec{v})$.
