Let $f(z)$ be a function of $z \in \mathbb{C}$.

Let there exist a vector field denoted $\vec{v}(z)$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$, such that $\vec{v}(z) = \overline{f(z)}$.

Let there exist a curve denoted $C \subset \mathbb{C}$, such that there exists a continuous range of values $\lambda \in [\alpha, \beta]$ with $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $C$ is described as below:<br/>
$z = \sigma + i\tau \in C, \sigma = f(\lambda), \tau = g(\lambda)$
